## About the Presentation Foundation

The Presentation Foundation is an initiative by the DJL Foundation, a nonprofit association based in Germany. Our mission is to make the management and distribution of presentation materials accessible, transparent, and community-driven. We believe that knowledge and educational resources should be easy to share, remix, and build upon—without unnecessary barriers or proprietary lock-in.

### Our Goals

- **Open Access:** Enable anyone to host, access, and distribute presentations freely, supporting both private and public sharing.
- **Simplicity:** Provide a platform that is intuitive and easy to use, lowering the technical barrier for educators, students, and organizations.
- **Transparency:** Operate as an open-source project, inviting contributions and feedback from the community. All code is public, and development is guided by the needs of our users.
- **Privacy and Control:** Respect user privacy and give users control over their data and content. We do not monetize user data or restrict access through paywalls.
- **Community Collaboration:** Foster a collaborative environment where improvements, ideas, and new features are shaped by contributors from around the world.

### Why Open Source?

We believe that open-source software empowers individuals and organizations to take ownership of their tools. By making our code and processes public, we encourage learning, transparency, and trust. Contributions are welcome from anyone who shares our vision for accessible, community-driven presentation management.
