## Polar.sh Review

This branch is dedicated to testing [Polar.sh](https://polar.sh) as a payment solution for the Presentation Foundation.

### Personal Review

I personally like Polar.sh. They have a great marketing team and a solid product. Their UI/UX is very well-designed.

### Cons

1. **Implementation Complexity**  
   Polar requires you to implement your payment platform yourself, such as building functions for the payment flow and creating webhooks to handle payment events. While this is the modern approach, I personally prefer a more out-of-the-box solution. On the bright side, Polar is hiring to develop a framework-friendly, UI-based solution, which could be promising in the future.

2. **Documentation Challenges**  
   The documentation is good but not very beginner-friendly. For example, understanding why the checkout page requires a session created by the server took some time. Errors like "Missing products in query params" were initially confusing.

3. **Currency Limitation**  
   Polar currently supports only USD, which is a drawback for me as a proud European. However, the Polar team has assured me that multi-currency support, including EUR (€), is planned for the end of this summer. Their quick response to my inquiry was appreciated, but I need a solution that supports multiple currencies out of the box.

### Final Thoughts

I like Polar.sh a lot and appreciate their frequent updates on X. However, the lack of EUR (€) support is currently a dealbreaker for me. I look forward to revisiting Polar.sh once these limitations are addressed.
